      <Prompt_Text>
        <Item>You nudge open the doorway at the bottom of the stairs, and push</Item>
        <Item>through it into a room full of various goods. Weapons. Armors.</Item>
        <Item>Scrolls. Potions. This place has it all. There's a [SHOPKEEPER]</Item>
        <Item>standing behind a counter at the back of it, and when you draw</Item>
        <Item>closer, he nods towards you. "Greetings," the [SHOPKEEPER] starts</Item>
        <Item>to say, but you cut him off with a chopping motion of your hand.</Item>
        <Item>"I'm not interested in talking to you," you say to him. "Shut up</Item>
        <Item>and let me look around."</Item>

      <Shop_Section>Sell</Shop_Section>
      <Prompt_Text>
        <Item>"I'm selling these," you toss a few items on the counter. "How</Item>
        <Item>much?" The [SHOPKEEPER] thinks for a moment, then replies "50% of</Item>
        <Item>market value." You think for a moment, nodding a little. Then you</Item>
        <Item>pull out a knife, twirling it between your fingers. "So, did you</Item>
        <Item>know that a human finger is about as hard to chop through as a</Item>
        <Item>carrot? Just thought you might find that interesting." The</Item>
        <Item>[SHOPKEEPER] turns a little pale and tries to pull his hand away.</Item>
        <Item>You stab a dagger right between his fingers. "I wouldn't," you</Item>
        <Item>tell him. "Now what I would do, is give the demon standing in</Item>
        <Item>front of you a fair price on his shit." The [SHOPKEEPER] gulps</Item>
        <Item>and nods. "Next time," you whisper, "I won't miss."</Item>

      <Shop_Section>Talismans</Shop_Section>
      <Prompt_Text>
        <Item>You grab a few strips of paper and adhesives and lay them out on</Item>
        <Item>the counter. "So, tell me what these do. Make it brief," you tell</Item>
        <Item>the [SHOPKEEPER]. "Well, that one is a talisman of heartsblood," </Item>
        <Item>he starts. "If you put it on your weapon it w-" You start</Item>
        <Item>flapping your hand in an imitation of him talking. "Blah blah</Item>
        <Item>blah blah. That's you right now. Make it brief or shut up and</Item>
        <Item>I'll figure it out myself," you tell the [SHOPKEEPER], sneering</Item>
        <Item>at him. He sighs and points to the first talisman. "Pierces</Item>
        <Item>better." The second: "fire hurts less." The third: "harder</Item>
        <Item>impacts." You reach up and pat him on the head. "Good. I'll teach</Item>
        <Item>you yet," you say. "I don't want any of these."</Item>

      <Shop_Section>Weapons</Shop_Section>
      <Prompt_Text>
        <Item>You turn to look over the weapon racks, rolling your eyes at the </Item>
        <Item>selection. Someone else seems to have beaten you here, however,</Item>
        <Item>and you're greeted by the imposing form of Falsael looking over a</Item>
        <Item>warhammer. She turns to you and her eyes light up - you can't</Item>
        <Item>tell whether it's happiness or malice - and she greets you; "'Sup</Item>
        <Item>lumpy?" You growl at her. "Don't fucking call me that." She bats </Item>
        <Item>your hand away before you can punch her, grinning. "Aw, c'mon.</Item>
        <Item>Don't be sore," she tells you. "What were you after, a dagger the</Item>
        <Item>size of your dick?" Your snarl at Falsael and shove her away, her</Item>
        <Item>mocking laughter ringing in your ear as you look at the rest of</Item>
        <Item>the weapons, scowling darkly.</Item>

      <Shop_Section>Weapons</Shop_Section>
      <Prompt_Text>
        <Item>You go over to the weapons and look around, almost immediately</Item>
        <Item>finding exactly what you wanted. Perfect. You grab a few daggers </Item>
        <Item>and start to toss them experimentally, catching them by the tips</Item>
        <Item>of the blade and twirling them in your fingers expertly. These</Item>
        <Item>aren't too bad, although you'd never say so publicly. You quietly</Item>
        <Item>put the weapons back, nodding to yourself.</Item>
