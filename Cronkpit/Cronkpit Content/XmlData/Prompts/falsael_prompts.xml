      <Prompt_Text>
        <Item>You leave the stairs at a brisk trot, only to find yourself in</Item>
        <Item>what seems like a shop. Racks of weapons and armor adorn the</Item>
        <Item>walls, with shelves of potions and scrolls in the back. At the</Item>
        <Item>other end of the room, there's a counter with a [SHOPKEEPER]</Item>
        <Item>standing behind it. You raise your hand and greet him cheerfully,</Item>
        <Item>He starts to return your gesture, but stops short and gives you</Item>
        <Item>an odd look. You're about to give him something to think about</Item>
        <Item>when you realize that he's probably staring at you because of</Item>
        <Item>your scorpion tail. "Don't get venom on my wares..." he mumbles</Item>
        <Item>at you. You roll your eyes at him and begin to browse.</Item>

      <Shop_Section>Intro</Shop_Section>
      <Prompt_Text>
        <Item>You take a step off the stairs, blood running off your armor in</Item>
        <Item>rivulets and pooling on the floor below. Truth be told, you can't</Item>
        <Item>tell whether its your blood or the blood of your enemies. The</Item>
        <Item>[SHOPKEEPER] behind the counter rushes over and starts to dab at</Item>
        <Item>your armor with a towel, sopping up the worst of the mess. You</Item>
        <Item>watch him warily, your tail ready to strike at moment's notice.</Item>
        <Item>His attentions seem sincere, and he takes up his post a moment</Item>
        <Item>later. "Thanks," you say shortly, never one to pass up a free</Item>
        <Item>armor cleaning. "Don't flatter yourself," he snaps back. "I'm</Item>
        <Item>just making sure you don't bleed on my wares." You stare blankly.</Item>
      </Prompt_Text>
    </Item>
    <Item>
      <Shop_Section>Scrolls</Shop_Section>
      <Prompt_Text>
        <Item>You take a look at the scroll and squint at it, carefully reading</Item>
        <Item>the runes. Your brows furrow as you take a moment to go over what</Item>
        <Item>Petaer told you in his lengthy explanation, carefully reciting to</Item>
        <Item>yourself. "Okay. I think I got this. This one makes you half-</Item>
        <Item>translucent, like looking through stained glass." You pause. </Item>
        <Item>"That's stupid. Why would anyone want that?" The [SHOPKEEPER]</Item>
        <Item>looks at you strangely. "You're holding it upside down," he</Item>
        <Item>'helpfully' points out. "Shut the fuck up. I didn't want your</Item>
        <Item>fucking opinion," you snap back, flipping him your middle finger.</Item>
        <Item>He takes the hint.</Item>
      </Prompt_Text>

      <Shop_Section>Sell</Shop_Section>
      <Prompt_Text>
        <Item>"I want to get rid of some of this shit. What's the going price</Item>
        <Item>around here?" You ask the [SHOPKEEPER], narrowing your eyes</Item>
        <Item>slightly at him. The [SHOPKEEPER] thinks for a moment, then</Item>
        <Item>replies "All items will be sold at half their market value." He</Item>
        <Item>barely has a moment to let out a strangled gasp as you lunge at</Item>
        <Item>him, picking him up by the collar and holding him in the air,</Item>
        <Item>your tail pressed to his throat. A single trickle of venom rolls </Item>
        <Item>down his neck as he makes small whimpering noises. "None of that </Item>
        <Item>shit," you hiss at him. "You WILL give me a fair price. Or I will</Item>
        <Item>kill you." "F-f-fine!" He stammers; "7% less than market value or</Item>
        <Item>less 500 gold, whichever is less! Oh gods, please don't kill me!"</Item>
      </Prompt_Text>

    <Item>
      <Shop_Section>Buyback</Shop_Section>
      <Prompt_Text>
        <Item>"Hey, I want some of that back," you point to your items behind</Item>
        <Item>the counter, then wave your hand impatiently. The [SHOPKEEPER]</Item>
        <Item>grumbles, but dutifully complies, grabbing a few of your items</Item>
        <Item>and putting them back on the counter. "And you'd better not even</Item>
        <Item>fucking think of trying to sell them back to me for the full</Item>
        <Item>value, do you understand?" For emphasis, you bury the tip of your</Item>
        <Item>tail in the counter. He gulps, but gives you a quick nod.</Item>

    <Item>
      <Shop_Section>Armor</Shop_Section>
      <Prompt_Text>
        <Item>You head back for the armor section, ignoring the piercing look</Item>
        <Item>the [SHOPKEEPER] is giving you. You look up and down the rows as</Item>
        <Item>you stroke your chin thoughtfully, mentally going over the advan-</Item>
        <Item>-tages and disadvantages of each type of armor he has in stock.</Item>
        <Item>Your critical gaze inspects them carefully for flaws as you hold</Item>
        <Item>a suit of chainmail up to the light, leaning in close to it. Good</Item>
        <Item>armor is what keeps you alive, and you'll be damned if you let </Item>
        <Item>him give you one that's of poor quality.</Item>
      </Prompt_Text>
    </Item>
    <Item>
      <Shop_Section>Consumables</Shop_Section>
      <Prompt_Text>
        <Item>You head over to the rows of bottles sitting on a shelf and pop</Item>
        <Item>one of them open, sniffing deeply. Mmmm, smells like cherries.</Item>
        <Item>The [SHOPKEEPER] protests, shouting: "Hey! Don't open those!!" at</Item>
        <Item>you. You wave dismissively over your shoulder as you take another</Item>
        <Item>deep whiff of the potion, letting out a hum of contentment.  You </Item>
        <Item>pop the cap shut and put it back on the shelf, smiling a little.</Item>
        <Item>"You could have compromised its purity!" The [SHOPKEEPER] shouts</Item>
        <Item>at you. You roll your eyes.</Item>
      </Prompt_Text>
    </Item>
    <Item>
      <Shop_Section>Weapons</Shop_Section>
      <Prompt_Text>
        <Item>You go through each weapon the shop has, pulling them each out of</Item>
        <Item>their spot on the racks and giving them each a test swing. You</Item>
        <Item>can hear the [SHOPKEEPER] protest as you put them back in a</Item>
        <Item>disorganized fashion, but you ignore him as each weapon hisses</Item>
        <Item>through the air with each swing, each weapon sounding ever so</Item>
        <Item>slightly different. Finally satisfied, you toss the last weapon</Item>
        <Item>aside and roll your shoulder back. "Are you going to put those</Item>
        <Item>back?" the [SHOPKEEPER] asks you, giving you an expectant look.</Item>
        <Item>You give him a flat stare and reply: "No."</Item>
      </Prompt_Text>
    </Item>
    <Item>
      <Shop_Section>Talismans</Shop_Section>
      <Prompt_Text>
        <Item>You look at the small strips of paper with the smaller adhesive</Item>
        <Item>strips attached to them, wondering how you're supposed to tell</Item>
        <Item>exactly what they do. That's when you get an idea. You go to the </Item>
        <Item>weapons and grab a dagger, then stick a couple of the strips on</Item>
        <Item>it. "What are you doing?!" the [SHOPKEEPER] yells at you. You</Item>
        <Item>wave him off as you then drive the dagger deep into one set of </Item>
        <Item>shelves, watching as some acid oozes out of the rend in the wood.</Item>
        <Item>"Stop that!" the [SHOPKEEPER] runs up and tries to stop you, but</Item>
        <Item>you easily shove him aside, knocking him down. "Shut up. Or I'll</Item>
        <Item>try these on you," you growl. After a bunch more test stabs,</Item>
        <Item>you're finally satisfied with the ones you've found.</Item>
