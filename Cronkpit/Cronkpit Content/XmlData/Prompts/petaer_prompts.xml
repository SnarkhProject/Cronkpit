      <Shop_Section>Intro</Shop_Section>
      <Prompt_Text>
        <Item>You come off the stairs and stride forward confidently, your</Item>
        <Item>cloak swishing about you. Your confident stride lasts all of two</Item>
        <Item>steps before your shoe gets caught in the foor, pitching you face</Item>
        <Item>forward. You close your eyes and brace for impact when a pair of</Item>
        <Item>strong arms catch you. You look up to see Ziktofel giving you a</Item>
        <Item>concerned look. "Are you okay?" She asks you. "Y-Yeah," you reply</Item>
        <Item>"I'm fine. Just my pride," you force a chuckle and stand back up,</Item>
        <Item>dusting off your robe. Falsael and Halephon are both giving you</Item>
        <Item>amused looks. It's telling that for once you're glad they agree</Item>
        <Item>on something.</Item>

    <Item>
      <Shop_Section>Weapons</Shop_Section>
      <Prompt_Text>
        <Item>You walk over to the weapon racks and look up and down the rows</Item>
        <Item>of armaments. There aren't a lot of weapons here that you know</Item>
        <Item>how to use, you're forced to admit. You know enough about staff</Item>
        <Item>combat to not completely embarass yourself, and you grab one,</Item>
        <Item>giving it a few test swings. Not bad. You gently tap it against</Item>
        <Item>the wall. Definitely not bad. You put it back in the racks, a</Item>
        <Item>small smile of satisfaction on your face.</Item>
      </Prompt_Text>
    </Item>
    <Item>
      <Shop_Section>Armor</Shop_Section>
      <Prompt_Text>
        <Item>You look at the robes. You've always loved robes. They're just...</Item>
        <Item>so soft and comfortable. You put one on and smile, snuggling into</Item>
        <Item>the soft cloth. You put another on, and another, and another.</Item>
        <Item>before you know it, you've tried on every single robe in the</Item>
        <Item>shop. Falsael is looking at you, a small grin on her face. "Easy </Item>
        <Item>there, robemaster," she tells you, patting you on the shoulder.</Item>
        <Item>"You should try one of these!" You urge her, "seriously, they're </Item>
        <Item>so very comfortable. You'll love it." Falsael thinks for a moment</Item>
        <Item>"Sure, why the hell not." She tosses off her armor and pulls one</Item>
        <Item>on. "Hmmm, not bad. Alright Petaer, I'll give you that one," she </Item>
        <Item>says, grinning. You say "yesssss," under your breath.</Item>

    <Item>
      <Shop_Section>Scrolls</Shop_Section>
      <Prompt_Text>
        <Item>You practically dive into the shelves full of scrolls, pulling</Item>
        <Item>them out and holding them up to examine them. They're all manner </Item>
        <Item>of spells, and you look at the [SHOPKEEPER] "Hey, do you know</Item>
        <Item>what these spells do?" He shakes his head a little, and you start</Item>
        <Item>reading off to him what each scroll does, translating each rune</Item>
        <Item>meticuously. You get about halfway through the scrolls before you</Item>
        <Item>see the [SHOPKEEPER] slumped over, asleep. Poor guy, he must not </Item>
        <Item>have gotten to bed at a reasonable time last night.</Item>
      </Prompt_Text>
    </Item>
    <Item>
      <Shop_Section>Consumables</Shop_Section>
      <Prompt_Text>
        <Item>There are a bunch of potions on the shelf, and you stare at them</Item>
        <Item>for a while. You'd always wondered exactly how the things were</Item>
        <Item>made, but nobody was ever around who could teach you about</Item>
        <Item>alchemy. Which is fine, really, the more you think about it. It's</Item>
        <Item>not like you aren't perfectly satisfied with your ability to</Item>
        <Item>wield magic, and you can't really think of what potions would add</Item>
        <Item>to your repitoire. You take one and swirl it experimentally,</Item>
        <Item>holding it up to the light. It looks nice. You'll give it that.</Item>
      </Prompt_Text>
    </Item>
    <Item>
      <Shop_Section>Talismans</Shop_Section>
      <Prompt_Text>
        <Item>You grab a bunch of the sticky paper strips and lay them out on</Item>
        <Item>the counter. "Oh wow, you have heartsblood here! And tenacity,</Item>
        <Item>and even bouyancy!" You gush. "Kid, be care-" The [SHOPKEEPER]</Item>
        <Item>tries to tell you, but you brush him off. "Do you know the origin</Item>
        <Item>of heartsblood? It's..." You launch into a lengthy explanation,</Item>
        <Item>talking over the [SHOPKEEPER] whenever he tries to cut you off.</Item>
        <Item>Finally, you finish your explanation with "neat, huh?" And go to </Item>
        <Item>pull the talismans off the counter. Oh. Uh. You seem to have</Item>
        <Item>gotten some stuck together. Oops. The [SHOPKEEPER] gives you a</Item>
        <Item>death glare as you sort of scamper off, your face beet red.</Item>
      </Prompt_Text>
    </Item>
    <Item>
      <Shop_Section>Sell</Shop_Section>
      <Prompt_Text>
        <Item>"How much can I give you these for?" You ask, putting some of</Item>
        <Item>your items on the counter. "You can give me them for free," the</Item>
        <Item>[SHOPKEEPER] replies, smirking. "Come on, you know what I meant."</Item>
        <Item>He sighs. "Okay. Okay. 50% of market value." Your jaw drops a</Item>
        <Item>little. "Only 50%?! Come on, don't rip me off here, I'm..." You</Item>
        <Item>launch into a lengthy explanation of how you're improving his</Item>
        <Item>buisness by killing off all the unsavory monsters around here,</Item>
        <Item>thus attracting good, wholesome customers. "ALRIGHT!" He yells</Item>
        <Item>halfway through your explanation. "93% or 500 less than the item</Item>
        <Item>value. Just please shut up. Please," he practically begs you.</Item>

    <Item>
      <Shop_Section>Buyback</Shop_Section>
      <Prompt_Text>
        <Item>You point at some of your stuff and open your mouth to talk, but </Item>
        <Item>the [SHOPKEEPER] slams down a couple of your items before you can</Item>
        <Item>say anything. "Nope. Nope. No need to say anything. Just please</Item>
        <Item>don't get started. I'll give you back exactly what you gave me, </Item>
        <Item>just please keep your mouth shut," he pleads, giving you a</Item>
        <Item>piteous stare. You grumble at his show of disrespect, but you</Item>
        <Item>decide to give him a pass as you contemplate which one of your</Item>
        <Item>items you want back. He must be cranky.</Item>
