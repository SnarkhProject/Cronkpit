        <h1>Cronkpit</h1>

<p>Cronkpit is a turn-based, visual roguelike written in C# with the XNA 4.0 Library. It's my first serious attempt at seeing finishing a game all the way through. Despite the fact that I've been forced to work on it mostly in my spare time, I've got most of the major game mechanics implemented. All of the dungeons are procedurally generated containing a fixed amount of gold, and you encounter a shop between each floor where you can buy (and then equip) a series of weapons and armor to help you kill more monsters. There are no rewards for killing monsters at present, so the player must pick their fights wisely.</p>

<p>So far there are:</p>

<ul>
<li>15 unique types of monsters that react differently to the player.</li>
<li>20 different armors the player can equip themselves with.</li>
<li>24 different weapons the player can use, and each type of weapon has its own special quirk.</li>
<li>20 powerful spells for the player, encompassing numerous types of magic.</li>
<li>12 different procedurally generated floors with a boss monster waiting at the end.</li>
<li>4 different characters and 4 different classes the player can choose, each with their own advantages and disadvantages</li>
</ul><p>There's no help screen implemented yet, so here's a brief list of controls:</p>

<ul>
<li>The numpad moves your character around. You can attack monsters by trying to move into a space they occupy.</li>
<li>I opens up an inventory screen where you can equip weapons and armor, as well as designate shortcuts for your various items.</li>
<li>If you have a bow or a crossbow equipped, pressing enter will allow you to attack with it.</li>
<li>F2 - F9 will use the various slots on the icon bar along the bottom of the screen. Swords and Maces have special attacks that can only be used in this fashion.</li>
<li>The left shift key will allow you to compare your currently equipped item with the currently selected item while you're in the shop.</li>
<li>Clicking on doors will allow you to attempt to open them. You can also walk into a door to try and open it, but some doors may be stuck or locked. There are other elements of the world you can click on to interact with too, such as altars.</li>
</ul><p><a href="http://imgur.com/a/AqceX#0">Screenshots from earlier in the development process.</a></p>

<p>Some screenshots from recent stages in development:</p>

<p>While this source is kept up-to-date, the game is not playable from there. Instead, you can download it <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/v7vc59anz1hgadb/CKpit.rar">here.</a> It will install and function properly as long as the latest version of the .NET framework is installed. New versions with major changes are released roughly once a month.</p>
